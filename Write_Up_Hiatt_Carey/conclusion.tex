\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

Our task was to take objective wine attributes of a certain wine and predict the
score that wine experts would give based on its own features. These results 
validate our conclusions that
our implementation of a k-fold cross validation model using ridge regression was
successful. Our evaluation of mean errors and the coefficient of determination scores
both implicate this conclusion. We still hold the same conclusions for our evaluation of lasso regression
based on its coefficient of determination value. However, we do believe that
the ridge regression model was more successful than the lasso regression model
based on the $R^{2}$ scores produced.
