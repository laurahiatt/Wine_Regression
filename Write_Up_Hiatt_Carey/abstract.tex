Wine quality is measured through sensory input. Given a set of 
scientific measurements of wine attributes, our experiment aims to see if through
k-fold cross validation with ridge regression and standard lasso regression
models we can estimate the quality value that experts would give 
to an unkown wine. Through our experiments,
we discovered that our models yield results that are better
than those produced from predicting the average wine quality score of all of the given samples
for each wine in a given data set. These results are concluded from the
results of measurements such as coefficients of determination, mean average errors and
mean squared errors.
